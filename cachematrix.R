## This function creates a special "matrix" object with the ability to cache its inverse.
## It contains four functions: 
      ## Set the value of the matrix
      ## Get the value of the matrix
      ## Set the inverse of the matrix
      ## Get the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  
}


## This function computes the inverse of the matrix. In the case that the inverse has already 
## been calculated and no changes to the matrix have been made, the function will retrieve 
## the inverse from cache instead of calculating it again. 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
